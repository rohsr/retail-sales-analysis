# 🛒 Retail Sales Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a fictional retail company's sales data to uncover trends, identify top-performing regions and customers, and detect underperforming product segments. The insights are presented via interactive dashboards in Tableau and Power BI, along with Python-based EDA.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Power BI**
- **Tableau Public**
- **Jupyter / VS Code**
- **Excel / CSV**

## 📁 Dataset
- [Superstore Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

## 📊 Key Visualizations

1. **Monthly Sales Trend** – Understand seasonal performance
2. **Sales by Region** – Compare regional performance
3. **Profit by Sub-Category** – Spot low-profit or loss-making products
4. **Top 10 Customers by Sales** – Identify high-value customers

## 💡 Key Insights

- **West region** generates the highest revenue; **Central** has lower profitability.
- **Office Supplies** have decent sales volume but low margin.
- Certain sub-categories (e.g., **Tables**, **Bookcases**) are consistently unprofitable.
- **Top 10 customers** contribute a significant portion of revenue — key for retention.
